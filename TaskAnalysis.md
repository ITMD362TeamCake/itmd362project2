# Task Analysis

Team Cake: Deborah Barndt, Sarah Holland, and Kyle Mahoney

## User Goals

This section defines what users (students) who visit the class website are hoping to achieve. They are listed in order of what we believe
is the most frequent/common goal to the least frequent/common goal. 

1. Check lab and project due dates
2. Review project descriptions and deliverables
3. Find professor contact information 
4. Locate class resources
5. Review syllabus/class information

## User Process

This section outlines the steps a user must take in order to achieve the goals listed above. This will be used to identify areas where we can improve
the user experience.

### 1. Check lab and project due dates: 
  * Open web browser
  * Enter URL
  * Scroll down past "Topic Schedule" to find "Homework Schedule" (about 3/4 down the page) 
  
#### Problems encountered: 
  * Due dates are just in a table, no links to lab or project descriptions or option to add to personal calendar 
  * Page navigation doesn't stay at the top of the screen 
  * The tables are not mobile-friendly; it's annoying to scroll through them on a phone
  
### 2. Review project descriptions and deliverables:
  * Open web browser
  * Enter URL
  * Click "Projects" link in page navigation 
  * Scroll to desired project
  * Scroll to desired project section
  
#### Problems encountered: 
  * if you want to review project 2 or 3, you must scroll past the earlier project(s)
  * must scroll/read through all parts of a project to find the information you need
  
### 3. Find professor contact information: 
  * Open web browser
  * Enter URL
  * Click professor name at the top of the page

#### Problems encountered:
  * Possibly too much text at the top of the page when viewing on mobile. Could just display the professor name/contact info link 
  * mailto: feature works beautifully on mobile devices but opens up a useless blank window on desktop 
  * Link to professor page on IIT website opens in current browser window (annoying) instead of new tab on desktop
  * Worth investigating: putting professor contact info at the top of the page instead of a link
  
### 4. Locate class resources: 
  * Open web browswer
  * Enter URL
  * Click "Links" link in page navigation
  
#### Problems encountered: 
  * Located at the bottom of the home page, so also not mobile-friendly (annoying horizontal scrolling)
  
### 5. Review syllabus/class information
  * Open web browser
  * Enter URL
  * Click "Syllabus" link in page navigation
  
#### Problems encountered:
  * A table makes the page unfriendly when viewing on mobile
  * User must scroll through a lot of unnecessary information if they need information in a section at the bottom
  * Too much text, especially on mobile

## Page-by-Page Tasks

This section lists improvement to be made for each page to address the problems encountered during each user process above. 

### 1. Home page ("Calendar")
  * Remove tables and replace with a mobile-friendly calendar view. Click on a date to view that date's topic, readings, and any assignments due
  * Include links to GitHub for labs and to the "Projects" page for projects. This might mean that labs need to be added to the projects page to form an "Assignments" page. 

### 2. Projects page
  * Make projects collapsable and expandable
  * Make inner project information collapsable and expandable 
  * Include dates on deliverables. Yes, this will be slightly redundant, but in a useful way, not in an obtrusive way. 
  * Similarly, include a link to the class GitHub and Basecamp at the top. 
  
### 3. Syllabus
  * Make all sections collapsable and expandable to reduce the large amount of text users have to scroll through.
  * Rearrange the order of some sections. For example, put the class day/time/location at the top of the page rather than buried in the middle. 
  * Include links for the textbooks
  * Remove essentially empty sections like "Quizzes", "Examinations", etc. 
  * Remove table for "grading" section and replace with a mobile-friendly way to display the data
  
## General Site Notes:
  * The color scheme is effective but dull, let's brighten it up
  * The site is very blocky and rectangular, we could try using color or some rounded edges to soften it up
  * Many parts of the website are not as mobile-friendly as they could or should be, we need to develop it mobile-first
  * The site is screaming for more functionality. For example, adding due dates to a personal calendar. Let's think of more ways we can make the site USEful, not just a text resource. 
  * Make a mobile friendly calendar that allows student to add the option to set reminders so that you don't miss assignments and due dates.
  * Allow the students to link the calendar to their own calendar and get automatic updates to any changes that are made.
  * The links section is good but there is so much more we could add. For example, the Google color theory website.
