## User Process

This section outlines the steps a user must take in order to achieve the goals listed above. This will be used to identify areas where we can improve
the user experience.

### 1. Check lab and project due dates: 
  * Open web browser
  * Enter URL
  * Scroll down past "Topic Schedule" to find "Homework Schedule" (about 3/4 down the page) 
  
#### Problems encountered: 
  * Due dates are just in a table, no links to lab or project descriptions or option to add to personal calendar 
  * Page navigation doesn't stay at the top of the screen 
  * The tables are not mobile-friendly; it's annoying to scroll through them on a phone
  
### 2. Review project descriptions and deliverables:
  * Open web browser
  * Enter URL
  * Click "Projects" link in page navigation 
  * Scroll to desired project
  * Scroll to desired project section
  
#### Problems encountered: 
  * if you want to review project 2 or 3, you must scroll past the earlier project(s)
  * must scroll/read through all parts of a project to find the information you need
  
### 3. Find professor contact information: 
  * Open web browser
  * Enter URL
  * Click professor name at the top of the page

#### Problems encountered:
  * Possibly too much text at the top of the page when viewing on mobile. Could just display the professor name/contact info link 
  * mailto: feature works beautifully on mobile devices but opens up a useless blank window on desktop 
  * Link to professor page on IIT website opens in current browser window (annoying) instead of new tab on desktop
  * Worth investigating: putting professor contact info at the top of the page instead of a link
  
### 4. Locate class resources: 
  * Open web browswer
  * Enter URL
  * Click "Links" link in page navigation
  
#### Problems encountered: 
  * Located at the bottom of the home page, so also not mobile-friendly (annoying horizontal scrolling)
  
### 5. Review syllabus/class information
  * Open web browser
  * Enter URL
  * Click "Syllabus" link in page navigation
  
#### Problems encountered:
  * A table makes the page unfriendly when viewing on mobile
  * User must scroll through a lot of unnecessary information if they need information in a section at the bottom
  * Too much text, especially on mobile
