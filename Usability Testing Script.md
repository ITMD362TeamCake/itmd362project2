# Usability Testing Script

Team Cake: Deborah Barndt, Sarah Holland, Kyle Mahoney, and Nihar Patel

## Introduction

Hi, [Tester's Name]. My name is [your name] and I'm going to be guiding you through this session. 
As a reminder, my team and I are asking you to use a website we've created and then answer some questions about your experience. The goal is to help us improve the site by solving any problems you encounter. The entire session should only take 10-15 minutes of your time.

I want to emphasize that the purpose of this session is to test the website, not to test you, so there is no bad question or wrong answer. Furthermore, I'd like to emphasize that we want you to be completely candid about your experience while using the site—you won't hurt our feelings by giving us negative feedback.

Please feel free to ask questions as we go along, but I may not be able to answer them right away. Part of this test's purpose is to see how easy it is to use our site when there's nobody sitting next to you to help. There will be an opportunity for me to answer all of your questions at the end of the session. 

Finally, it is important for you to know that the feedback you give me today will be shared with the other members of my development team and used as part of our final class project; however, your name and other personal information won't be shared. At this time, please take a moment to read and sign this permission form.

## BASIC QUESTIONS

Thank you, now I'm going to ask you to answer a few basic questions about your computer/website use habits: 

1.	How many hours per day, approximately, do you spend using a computer? 
2.	How many hours per day, approximately, do you spend browsing the internet? 
3.	Do you work in an IT/Computer Science/Development position (e.g., systems administration, web/application development, networking, etc.)? 
4.	Do you usually browse the internet on a mobile device, desktop/laptop computer, or equally? 

## HOME PAGE

*	Before beginning, record the platform (laptop/desktop? mobile phone?, etc.) and web browser being used

Thank you for that information. Next I'd like you to take a look at the website's homepage. Take a few minutes to scroll around and read the information on the home page, but don't click on anything yet. 

*	Ask the following questions after a couple of minutes:

1.	Can you easily identify the site's purpose? Who would use this website? 
2.	Can you easily tell what types of things can be done on this website?
3.	Can you easily tell who owns the site? 

  
## TASKS

Thank you for your feedback. Now I'm going to ask you to perform a few specific tasks. As you complete these tasks, please let us know if you encounter any problems or if you encounter something about the site you really like. 
  
1.	Find the due date for Lab 7
2.	What is the lecture subject for the week of February 20? What are that day's readings? 
3.	What is the first deliverable for Project Two and when is it due? 
4.	What is the goal of Project Three? 
5.	What is the attendance policy for this class? 
6.	How many total points are the labs for this class worth? 
7.	Who is the professor for this class? 
8.	Can you find a link to the class Github and class Basecamp? 
9.	What percentage of your grade do you lose if your code doesn't pass validation?

Do you have any final questions for us? 

Do you have any additional feedback about the website?
